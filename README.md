# Logbook

This is my 3rd attempt at making an app for tracking your rowing machine progress

## Lesson learned from previous attempts

- Having a "perfect" and "revolutionary" way to enter that much data is a whole project on it's own. Don'e let that
bring your spirit down and give up

## Scope of this app (MVP)

- Store workout history in local storage
- Multiple pages so that it's easier to see how you progress

## TODO

- [ ] deal with all the saved states
